# Weather App with API
Weather App that enables users to find the temperature of cities across the world.
I made this project to practice working with APIs can get used to API calls and responses.

## Features
- Search bar for the user to type in the given city
- A "Get Weather" button which triggers a fetch request to the API
- The API response: The city's name, country, temperature, 'feels like' temperature and humidity
- A professional animation for the api response data, fading onto the screen
